## UX

### Project Purpose

The main goal of the Destination Poland is to help find perfect stay in Poland for customers of all ages.

### Design

The design of the page is minimalism and easy to move around the pages which help with good experience.

- #### Fonts

    - The fonts **'Raleway'**, **'Poppins'** were chosen as they simple and easy to read as well it is fitts to theme of my page to keep minimalism around the design.
    

- #### Colours

    - **All Pages -** A white background was chosen to keep simplicity and good looking design.
    
    - **Social links -** A blue color was chosen as a good contrast between background and links.
    
    - **Icons on the Map -** Icons were changed on the map to make easier for the user to see where each place is. As well I add **click** function with contents to be available to users.
    
    - **All Pages -** A white background with black text was chosen to keep minimalism and ensure that is easily displayed for all age of our users.
    
    - **Links -** A red colour has been chosen once hoverring on each link which make nice contrast between the background and links.
    
    - **Submit Button -**A delicate grey colour was choosen to make soft accent on the **Contact Page**, as well hoverring on the button will change on red which matching the 
    link settings.
    
    - **Pictures -** All theme of pictures are the same which make nice and good connection between the pages.
    
   
- #### Styling

    Styles of the each page was choosen to match all, that the user changing the page from one to another willl see the connection as well as pictures.
    I tried to keep minimalism and do not add too much content on pages as some of the users may leave the page due too overloaded pages.
    As well my styling fits to every age of the users as it is simple and tidy.

    All images have been choosen to match and have been downloaded from pinteres.
